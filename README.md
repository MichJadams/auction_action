# Auction Actions

This is a simulator program for three different types of auctions - Dutch auctions, Vickrey actions and penny auctions. Participents can sit at a single computer (rather cramped, I know) and undergo these three different auction types.

The inspiration for this project was twofold. One, I am interested in game mechanics and I think specifically mixing up auction types is an under utilized tool. I wanted to learn more about the different auction types. The second inspiration is to create a program using only the core library (in this case of python)
